# [E3] Advanced step-by-step simulation

In this module we will again (as in [E1]) use an interactive simulation of a reactive system implementation using the Spectra Controller walker. We will see how to use advanced features like breakpoints and exploring reachability.

## Task at end of video

Synthesize a controller for specification [TrafficA1.spectra](TrafficA1.spectra) and check whether a state with `carA & carB & greenB` is reachable for the synthesized controller.
